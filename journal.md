##### Thoughts regarding team member

Andre Watts was great to work with. Though our schedules were challenging and we both worked separately for the most part, I felt we both communicated well and I enjoyed the project very much. I found Andre to be positive and easy to bounce ideas off of. I would enjoy working with him again.

##### Thoughts regarding project

I found the project to be great practice to better fine tune all the overall concepts I have learned thus far in HTML and CSS. It was challenging enough and in some areas where I felt I had solid grasp on I realized I could use more improvement. For example, there was some initial head scratching on the  positioning of elements. Also, I found the making of the various *book purchase* buttons helpful and approached each one a bit differently. 

I also learned new techniques, such as how to do vertical tabs and I was happy that I figured out on my own how to make the linear-gradients color-stop like the Gumroad screenshot showed. I also got more familiar in the scaling of the site based off of the screenshot as well as manipulating the site colors further.

I look forward to doing further refactoring on the site to make it responsive. In its present incarnation, most dimensions were intentionally fixed as if the viewable browser window was at full width.
I also look forward to making the site interactive when the time comes.
